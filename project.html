            <div class="intro-text">
                <p>As a Colorado native and a seasoned real estate professional, I recognize and value the trust my
                    clients place in me, and I strive every day to exceed their expectations. I have been a leading top
                    producer for over 18 years. My sales consistently rank in the top 1% of all Keller Williams Teams
                    Internationally. Prior to entering real estate, I served my country in the United States Army
                    Infantry with multiple tours in Iraq and Kuwait. These experiences instilled in me the discipline it
                    takes to build the most powerful real estate team in Colorado. Outside of real estate, I take pride
                    in giving back to the community and serve as a Board Member of Third Way Center, which helps
                    high-risk, disadvantaged youth become successful adults.</p>

                    <p>Before choosing a real estate agent, I conducted a lot of research to see who would be the best
                        choice based on the investment they make into selling the property (time and effort, not
                        necessarily
                        financially) and how they promote their listings. The Steve Silver Real Estate Team stood out
                        as the
                        best Louisville has to offer: their organic rankings are excellent (meaning people find listings
                        on
                        his site easily), their social media presence was strong, and I could tell they put a lot of
                        work
                        into their listings</p>

                        January in the same building he lives in. Steve was extremely
                        helpful, open, transparent, and reliable through the whole process, he really cared about us,
                        understood our needs from the very first open house even giving us ideas on how better utilize
                        the space. </p>

                    <p>Steve was more than helpful in finding us an apartment in . He was extremely
                        honest, upfront, and was able to find us a great apartment that fit right in our price range! He
                        was extremely communicative and easy to reach to answer any of our questions at all times.

                    <p>Steve is the best! he was thorough and professional and great to work with. he kept us
                        apprised about
                        available appointments and always let us know as soon as a new one came on the market. he was
                        honest and forthright- no games. After dealing with several other brokers in the
                        area and being disappointed, we felt lucky to find
                        brendan.</p>
